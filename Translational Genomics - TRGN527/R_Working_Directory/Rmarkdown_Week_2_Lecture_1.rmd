# Computing basic statistics in R
# With the following numbers: 1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,20,22,35
# Calculate the mean, median, standard deviation, variance and mode.
```{R}
#Create a vector with numbers
x <- c(1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,20,22,35)
```

#Calculating the mean
```{R}
mean(x)
```

#Calculating the median
```{R}
median(x)
```

#Calculating the Standard Deviation
```{R}
sd(x)
```

#Calculating the variance
```{R}
var(x)
```

#Calculating the mode
```{R}
# Creating a function named "getmode"
getmode <- function(x) {
  uniqx <- unique(x)   
  uniqx[which.max(tabulate(match(x, uniqx)))]}

# Creating a vector with numbers
x <- c(1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,20,22,35)
# Calculating the mode

calculating_mode <- getmode(x)
calculating_mode
```
