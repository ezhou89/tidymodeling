# Hypothesis Testing

# Using function pnorm() in order to find the p-value:
```{R}
pnorm(-1, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE)
```



# For the BMI example, z-score was 1.67. 
# For the one-sided hypothesis of the form H0 : μ > μ0, 
# We need to find the upper tail probability of 1.67 as follows:
```{R}
pnorm(1.67, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = FALSE)
```



# When σ2 is unknown and we need to use the data to estimate it separately:
```{R}
pt(5.33, df = 199, lower.tail = FALSE)
```



# Alternatively, instead of calculating the t-score and finding the appropriate tail probabilities to obtain the p-value, we can use the function t.test(). 
# For the BMI example, we use this function as follows:

```{R}
# install.packages("MASS")
library(MASS)

t.test(x = Pima.tr$bmi, mu = 30, alternative = "two.sided")
```



# Estimating the interval at other confidence levels (instead of 0.95) by using the option conf.level:
```{R}
t.test(x = Pima.tr$bmi, mu = 30, conf.level = 0.9)
```



# Shapiro–Wilk test of normality
```{R}
shapiro.test(x = Pima.tr$bmi)
```
