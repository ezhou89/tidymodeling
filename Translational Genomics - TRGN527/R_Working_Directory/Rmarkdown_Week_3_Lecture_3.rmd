# The following code is explained in the Week 3 Lecture 3

## Distributions:
# Normal Distributions
```{R}
rnorm(5, mean = 25, sd = 4)
```

```{R}
x <- seq(from = 10, to = 40, length = 100)
```

```{R}
fx <- dnorm(x, mean = 25, sd = 4)
plot(x, fx, type = "l", xlab = "BMI",
     ylab = "Density", main = "TRGN 599: N(25, 16)")
abline(h = 0, col = "gray")
```

```{R}
pnorm(18.5, mean = 25, sd = 4,
        lower.tail = TRUE)
```

```{R}
qnorm(0.05, mean = 25, sd = 4,
      lower.tail = T)
```

```{R}
pnorm(30, mean = 25, sd = 4) - 
  pnorm(25, mean = 25, sd = 4)
```

```{R}
Fx <- pnorm(x, mean = 25, sd = 4)
plot(x, Fx, type = "l", xlab = "BMI",
     ylab = "Cumulative Probability",
     main = "TRGN 599: N(25, 16)")
abline(h = 0, col = "gray")
```
